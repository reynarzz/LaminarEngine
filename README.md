- [ ] Make the demo game (Proper architecture).
- [ ] Linux, and IOS support.

### Platforms
- Windows
- MacOs
- Android (Experimental)

## Getting Started
#### Note: If you are only interested in playing the game, download the repo, and go to DemoBin/win32

- Windows or macOS: .NET 9.0 SDK or later: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0
- cd Editor
- dotnet build
- If using Visual Studio, select the editor as the startup project.
- Building the game: Open the editor and go to the Build tab and hit the build button on the top. The binaries can be found on: _Ship/<platform_name>, or your custom path.
  
  
Recommended
